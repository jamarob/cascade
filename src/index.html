  <h1>Cascade (computer virus)</h1>
  <p>The Cascade virus (also known as Herbstlaub in Germany) is a prominent computer virus that was a resident written
    in assembly language, that was widespread in the 1980s and early 1990s. It infected .COM files and had the effect
    of making text on the screen cascade down and form a heap at the bottom of the screen. It was notable for using an
    encryption algorithm to avoid being detected. However, one could see that infected files had their size increased
    by 1701 or 1704 bytes. In response, IBM developed its own antivirus software.</p>
