    <p data-js="cascade-target" class="cascade-text">The Cascade virus (also known as Herbstlaub in Germany) is a
      prominent computer virus
      that was a resident written
      in assembly language, that was widespread in the 1980s and early 1990s. It infected .COM files and had the effect
      of making text on the screen cascade down and form a heap at the bottom of the screen. It was notable for using an
      encryption algorithm to avoid being detected. However, one could see that infected files had their size increased
      by 1701 or 1704 bytes. In response, IBM developed its own antivirus software.</p>
